# Transformers for Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation: A Smart City Application

This repository contains the code and resources for applying transformer models for object detection and semantic segmentation tasks within the Smart City context. The aim of this project is to demonstrate how these advanced techniques can enhance public safety and city planning.

# Description

The project makes use of transformer models, a powerful tool initially developed for natural language processing (NLP), but now being utilized in the field of computer vision. The primary tasks include object detection and semantic segmentation on CCTV images for enhanced public safety. The models detect individuals and identify details such as clothing and accessories using semantic segmentation. This detailed information can help in locating missing persons or identifying suspects in public safety incidents.
